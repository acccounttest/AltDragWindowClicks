# AltDragWindowClicks
___
---

Eventually press and release a first <kbd> Alt </kbd> alone.
```
;  Alt + Left Button  : Drag and move the windows.
;  Alt + Right Button : Drag and resize the windows.
;  Double-Alt + Left Button   : Minimize the windows.
;  Double-Alt + Right Button  : Maximize/Restore the windows.
;  Double-Alt + Middle Button : Kill the window.
```

Optionnaly you could want directly <kbd> Alt+left </kbd> or <kbd> Alt+right </kbd> click a window,
 this is completely unecessary, the windows managing system is completly different, usually windows
  have their *own position and size* for a good reason, either the maximal available space possible is
   covered or the window status will change depending same or other condition(s) as values, the reason of this is:
 - When using the program *CTM*, or in other situations when, the window become *unresponsive* or the window is not draggable or resizable,
  the way to do it could be send <kbd> Alt </kbd>, one time is enough, and then press <kbd> double left </kbd> or <kbd> double right </kbd> clicks, works only like that.
 - Rarely change the position or sizes of windows can be *fast* and intuitive.


The other reason is sometimes kill a window is not probant, to be really certain what window you kill you could
 want have to press <kbd> Esc </kbd> *two times*, the first time will last a while and end without taking any action, send <kbd> Esc </kbd> normally coud be done by press it longly or three times.(Maybe as switch that renew timeleft every press)
